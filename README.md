**# $BELOV Token Metadata Storage

**$BELOV** is a Solana token project with metadata storage, designed for experimentation and learning in blockchain development.  
The repository stores token metadata and provides references for on-chain exploration.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- How to create and manage a **custom token on Solana**
- How to store and manage token metadata efficiently
- CLI-based automation of token operations using [solana_token_manager](https://github.com/kirill-a-belov/solana_token_manager)

While inspired by meme tokens like $TRUMP ([gettrumpmemes.com](https://gettrumpmemes.com/)), the focus is on **practical blockchain development techniques**.
